        This example shows you how to use the
        <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-angular/tree/master"
          >Okta Angular Library</a
        >
        and the
        <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget"
          >Okta Sign-In Widget</a
        >
        to add the
        <a
          href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-auth-code-pkce"
          >PKCE Flow</a
        >
        to your application. This combination is useful when you want to
        leverage the features of the Sign-In Widget and the authentication
        helper components from the okta-angular module.

        Once you have logged in, you will be redirected through your
        authorization server (the issuer defined in config) to create a session
        for Single-Sign-On (SSO). After this, you will be redirected back to the
        application with an ID Token and Access Token. The tokens will be stored
        in local storage for future use.

        You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org and have been
        redirected back to this application. You now have an ID Token and access
        token in local storage. Visit the <a href="/profile">My Profile</a> page
        to take a look inside the ID Token.
      </p>
      <!-- <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, this application is a stand-alone front-end application. At
        this point, you can use the access token to authenticate yourself
        against resource servers that you control.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sample is designed to work with one of our resource server
        examples. To see access token authentication in action, please download
        one of these resource server examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li *ngFor="let example of resourceServerExamples">
          <a href="{{ example.url }}">{{ example.label }}</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you have downloaded and started the example resource server, you
        can visit the <a href="/messages">My Messages</a> page to see the
        authentication process in action.
